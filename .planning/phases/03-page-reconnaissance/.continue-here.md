<current_state>
Phase 3 (Page Reconnaissance) is COMPLETE and VERIFIED (5/5 must-haves). All 7 plans executed across 3 waves. Phase completion committed. Next action is Phase 4 (Match Discovery) — needs planning first via `/gsd:discuss-phase 4` or `/gsd:plan-phase 4`.
</current_state>

**This session: Full Phase 3 execution**

- Wave 1: 03-01 (Sample Manifest) — 48 HTML samples fetched and archived to `data/recon/`
- Wave 2 (parallel): 03-02 through 03-06 — CSS selector maps for all 5 page types
  - 03-02: Results listing (458 lines, 20 selectors)
  - 03-03: Match overview (677 lines, 9 samples verified)
  - 03-04: Map stats (524 lines, 17 scoreboard columns)
  - 03-05: Performance (872 lines, FusionChart JSON extraction)
  - 03-06: Economy (615 lines, FusionChart JSON extraction)
- Wave 3: 03-07 — Cross-page synthesis (401 lines) and edge case reference (531 lines)
- Verification: 5/5 must-haves passed
- ROADMAP.md, STATE.md, REQUIREMENTS.md all updated
- RECON-01 through RECON-05 marked Complete in traceability table
</completed_work>

**Phase 4: Match Discovery** (not yet planned)
- 3 placeholder plans in ROADMAP.md (04-01, 04-02, 04-03) — need `/gsd:plan-phase 4`
- Goal: Paginate HLTV results pages to collect all CS2-era match IDs

**Overall project:** Phases 4-9 remain (Phase 3 of 9 complete, ~33%)
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

Key findings from Phase 3 that affect future phases:

- **Rating 2.0 still exists**: Sample 162345 (Sep 2023, tier-3) uses Rating 2.0 format. Parsers MUST detect and handle both versions. Detection: `th.st-rating` text on map stats page (primary), FusionChart last bar label on performance page (secondary).
- **FusionCharts JSON is primary data source** for performance and economy pages — data is in `data-fusionchart-config` attribute, not HTML tables.
- **Economy data available for all eras** (2023-2026) with identical DOM structure. OT economy data missing for MR12 matches only.
- **Forfeit detection at match overview time**: mapname == "Default" means skip sub-page fetches.
- **Big-results section** on results page 1 is duplicate — use last `.results-all` container.
- **Two .veto-box elements**: first = format info, second = actual vetoes.
- **Rankings** are in `.lineups .box-headline .teamRanking`, NOT in `.team{1,2}-gradient`.
- **Multi-kill/clutch stats NOT on performance page** — only on map stats overview page.
- **Eco-adjusted stats NOT on performance page** — only on map stats overview page.

None. Clean state, all phases verified, ready to proceed.

<context>
Phase 3 was a pure reconnaissance/documentation phase — no application code written, only analysis scripts in `scripts/` and selector map docs in `.planning/phases/03-page-reconnaissance/recon/`. The output is consumed by Phases 4-7 as reference when building actual parsers.

The selector maps are detailed enough that parsers can be written directly from them without re-analyzing HTML. Each map includes verified CSS selectors, annotated HTML snippets, edge case handling, and extraction code sketches.
</context>

<next_action>
Start Phase 4 planning: `/gsd:discuss-phase 4` or `/gsd:plan-phase 4`

Phase 4 (Match Discovery) will use the results listing selector map from 03-02 to build a paginator that discovers all CS2-era match URLs from HLTV `/results?offset=N` pages.
